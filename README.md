# MLOps Lifecycle Management

Welcome to the MLOps Lifecycle Management repository! This project serves as the foundation for MLOps/MLOps implementation in Cloud Agnostic environments.

## What is MLOps?

MLOps, or Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations, is a multi-layered technology platform that automates and enhances IT operations through analytics and machine learning. MLOps enables organizations to simplify and accelerate IT operations, enhance service quality, and proactively prevent issues.

## Project Overview

MLOps Lifecycle Management aims to standardize, manage, and orchestrate the entire lifecycle of MLOps/MLOps-related workflows, from initial development to deployment, integration to continuous maintenance and improvement. This ensures the robustness, scalability, and compliance of the MLOps system over time.

It standardizes and manages the lifecycle of resources involved in MLOps/Mlops, allowing ML/DS Engineers to focus on developing the actual code and data science tasks while ensuring that the entire lifecycle of their models is managed efficiently and effectively.

## Key Features

* **Simplicity**: Easy to use and deploy, with a template-based approach for end-to-end data science.
* **Modularity**: Designed to be modular, allowing for easy integration with existing infrastructure.
* **Repeatability & Security**: Ensures repeatable and secure deployments, with built-in compliance and governance features.
* **Collaboration**: Facilitates collaboration among AI/ML teams, ensuring seamless communication and coordination.
* **Enterprise Readiness**: Designed to meet the needs of large-scale enterprises, with scalability and reliability in mind.

## Project Goals

MLOps Lifecycle Management is designed to provide a set of standardized, automated, and collaborative processes with best practices that enable AI/ML teams to efficiently deploy their machine learning models into cloud agnostic environments.

## Prerequisites

1. A cloud account subscription.
2. For GitHub-based deployments and projects:
	* Azure CLI
	* GitHub client
3. Git bash, WSL, or another shell script editor on your local machine
